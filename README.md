## Introduction

Welcome to the Agricultural Renaissance project, an in-depth exploration into the dynamic realm of agricultural productivity. This project conducts a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unravel the patterns and trends associated with the sustained increase in crop yields over time.


## Analysis

The analysis process involves the following steps:
1. Data collection and cleaning.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize and interpret trends.
3. Statistical analysis to quantify the general trend and variability.
4. Identification of influencing factors, including technological advancements, climate variations, and policy interventions.
5. Regional analysis to assess geographic variations in crop production trends.


## Usage

1. Open the [Agricultural Renaissance- Analyzing the Patterns of Increasing Crop Yields.ipynb](https://github.com/LAKAHDKISAR/Agricultural-Renaissance_Analyzing-the-Patterns-of-Increasing-Crop-Yields/blob/main/Agricultural%20Renaissance-%20Analyzing%20the%20Patterns%20of%20Increasing%20Crop%20Yields.ipynb) notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to execute the analysis and view visualizations.
3. Explore the code and comments to understand the methodology and findings.
